# ENGL 411
This repository contains lecture notes, readings/reflections, and other information pertinent to ENG 411: Technology, Rhetoric, and Professional Communication. This will help me organize content and allow me to be more efficient as a student. In addition, this repository acts as a way for my peers to exchange opinions/ideas on readings and assignments. Currently, I have included an overview and demo file, a readings folder, and a README file.
