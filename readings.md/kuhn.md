# Kuhn - Introduction: A Role for History
Essay describes how we have been misled by scientific text. Scientific works and textbooks often show concepts of science that can be misleading and biased in a way that aims to influence readers to view things in a particular way.

We are continously drawing information from these sources and becoming manipulated by the recurring strategies that are utilized. Science is described as techniques and research that is being conducted, not the actual facts.

If science consists of a group of these facts, theories, and methods, then scientists are the men who have contributed to the “particular constellation.” There are two main tasks of concern for the historian: When was the fact/law/theory discovered or invented? What are the collections of error, myth, and superstition that have played fragments into modern science text?

Historians are finding that the more they dig into their research, the harder it is to find answers to questions such as ‘when was oxygen discovered?,’ etc. Perhaps it is not best to base scientific development based on series of subsequent discoveries.

The progress of scientific development is influenced by both mechanisms that are utilized as well as the historical context.
