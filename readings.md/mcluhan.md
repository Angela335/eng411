# Mcluhan - THe Medium is the Message
In McLuhan's text, the author describes how mechanization has changed how our society interacts with one another and our wordly perspectives. It has changed human relationships and works in a more complex way than it has before. Instead of the importance of the message of the medium, what is more important is the kind of medium that we utilize.

**_What is the nature of technology and technological change and how are these rhetorical?_**
* The way a message is conveyed through a particular technology changes the perception of the audience. As technology continues to grow, so does the different interpretations it has from consumers of that medium. When it comes to digital technology such as social media, it is known to be a double edged sword. While digital technology has been utilized as an effective medium for a wide range of political movements and advocations, the increasing concern regarding confidential information and lack of privacy has only gotten more detrimental.

**_What does it mean to be human in a technological world?_**
* With advancements in technology, people now need to establish  a new identity for themselves to make them unique from AI.
* We have the responsibility to acknowledge and understand the impact of the mediums we use and put out to society.

**_What is the relationship between the new and the old?_**
* In the text, Mcluhan states how "[t]the railway did not introduce movement or transportation or wheel or road into human society, but it accelerated and enlarged the scale of previous human functions, creating totally new kinds of cities, and new kinds of work and leisure." Hence, old forms of mediums have paved the way for new ones and has opened a path for societal advancements.

The text explains how we used to emphasize more about the message that the medium contains, not necessarily the medium. However, the author illustrates how nowadays it is actually the type of medium that shapes the message and how we perceive and react to it.

**_Questions to ask for discussion_**

* What are some examples of how current social media portrays Mcluhan's message? What are some recent pivotal trends, political events, etc. that have occured that relate to the author's message?
* How do you percieve, react, and absorb information about a serious news story from a newspaper versus through an app such as TikTok?
* Do we feel that our attention span has shifted in the past few years as technology progressed? Has it stayed the same? Gotten worse? Gotten better?
